        <h2>Indian Chole Aloo Tikki</h2>
        <P>
            Aloo Tikki Chole or Chole Aloo Tikki is a much-loved chaat dish that can be seen and enjoyed on the streets of North India. The two elements, Aloo Tikki – spiced potato cutlets or patties (sometimes with different fillings) and Chole – the well-known spicy chickpea curry, are quite the match made in heaven. This Aloo Tikki Chole recipe has the addition of yummy chutneys which takes the overall flavor, a notch higher

            This is a delicious vegan Indian recipe where vegetables and chickpeas are served over small potato cakes. It works well as a starter for four, or as a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate, serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for Indian sauces - coriander sauce and tamarind sauce - are on this site. Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices of fresh onion
